#Wordinator

This is a simple API using Sinatra that accepts two words and returns whether or not the words are anagrams. The two words are entered into url separated by a "/".

##Approach
I wansn't familiar at all with APIs so I had to do a little reading to start off. The resources below were extremely helpful in hepling me figure out that to do. Once I figured out how and API works, I simply needed to write the code to see if the two words are anagrams. My code just sorts each words characters alphabetically and checks to see if they are equal.
